## 1. Context

I decided to design a website for an individual who is a professional fitness instructor and swimming teacher. Iain Hurton is a long-time family friend who found a passion for health and fitness after finishing secondary school. Iain is now a fully qualified fitness instructor, personal trainer, swimming teacher and lifeguard. 

In recent years, I have been amazed and inspired by Iain’s work ethic and willingness to grow his fitness brand. He is very friendly, motivating and encouraging to everyone taking part in his group fitness classes. Iain has shown his ability to adapt to unexpected situations. In recent years, Iain was forced to pivot to online classes while lockdown measures prevented groups from forming in large numbers and put a halt to swimming classes for an extended period.

I chose to create a website specifically for Iain after following his progress for a number of years. It was clear that he would gain some benefit from having an online presence other than social media platforms. Iain has already generated a strong following on social media platforms particularly Instagram and Facebook. 

He has gained a promising client base with men and women ranging from teenagers to retired people. For this reason, I thought he would greatly benefit from having a website which could be accessed by existing clients, potential clients and others wanting to learn more about Iain Hurton's lifestyle and his overall approach to health and fitness.

## 2. User Experience (UX)

### The Five Planes of UX

#### The Strategy Plane

After conducting market research on friends, peers and family members

I identified a niche market which can be utilised by anyone who craves Irish food and beverages no matter where they are in the world. I want to create an application focusing purely on the most popular Irish goods which are not easily found outside of Ireland. Every shopper will have the ability to create their own account, safely provide their personal information and securely complete an order.

#### The Scope Plane

When deciding on the scope of my project, I decided to design a website allowing users to create an account, browse products, add items to their shopping cart and securely complete an order. The primary feature will be the capability to purchase a product through a secure checkout using Stripe Payments. Shoppers can easily sort products by name, price or category. Shoppers can easily search for products, using keywords. To improve the user experience, I want users to be notified of their actions, such as shopping bag updates as well as success and error messages.

#### The Structure Plane

After deciding on the features I wanted to include, I focused on the overall structure of the website. I want to keep the design clean and sleek. All potential customers will be able to search for a product using keywords but can also use a sorting feature depending on the needs of the user. I am using the grid system from Bootstrap to clearly display the content of each page. The navigation bar will change depending if the user is anonymous or logged in. Clicking 'Profile' in the navigation bar, reveals more options via a dropdown list. The store owner (admin), signed in as a superuser, can also access the product management page. The store owner will have the option to add, edit or delete items from the product range.

#### The Skeleton Plane

I wanted a clear, simple structure throughout the website. Each page will have a fixed navigation bar with consistent styling and prominent call-to-action buttons. There will be a large call-to-action button on the home screen to invite shoppers to browse all products. Each page has a unique heading so users are aware of which page they are on at all times. The products page displays all items neatly, allowing users to view multiple products on the same page. Clicking on a product will direct the shopper to a more detailed view about the individual item. Shoppers can simply add items to their shopping bag with a toast message appearing in the top right corner of the screen when an action is completed. Users can enter their personal information confident in the application's security features. Shoppers can complete their checkout and receive an email confirmation of their order.

#### The Surface Plane

From conducting research on similar e-commerce sites, I discovered most online stores are quite colourful and brimming with information. Conversely, I wanted to keep the design sleek and simple, only displaying relevant information to the user. Initially, I sketched ideas and wireframes onto paper, before recreating more advanced wireframes online. I designed all the pages for desktop and smaller screen sizes showing the structure and content on the different devices.

<span  id="design"></span>

## 3. Design & Development

During the research phase of this project, I posed the following questions to friends, family members and peers living abroad:

- Which Irish goods do you desire most while living abroad?



### Target Market

The target audience for this webpage is anyone who wants to find a personal trainer or a group of people to exercise with on a regular basis.

### Overview

The website was designed with the following main objectives:

- To allow users to browse all products in our database using sorting and searching features


### **Project Goals**


### Application Features

- About
- Contact
- Events
- Gallery
- FAQs
- Personal Training
- Fitness Bootcamps
- Social Media Profiles

### Design Process

The primary design goal in mind when designing this application is to attract the customer to explore further. The landing page is bright and striking with a prominent call-to-action button.

- Design a bright and visually appealing application.

- Design an intuitive and easy to navigate website.

- Achieve a clean aesthetic displaying only the necessary information.

- Use Bootstrap4 features for the layout and structure of the application

- Use Bootstrap4 classes and components to provide structure as well as highlighting and enhancing different elements.

- Design an application which is responsive on all screen sizes.

- Design a logo that is simple, attractive and memorable.

The colour scheme chosen for this project was inspired by bright colours to give the website an attractive, vibrant look. The white background gives a sleek, neutral look to the application with gold and black nicely complementing.

![Colour Scheme]()

- **#FFFFFF White** is the backdrop of all headings and text on the website. The bright colour emphasises clarity and removes visual clutter. The black text is easily readable on the white background.

- **#FFFFFF Black** is used for headings and text on the website. The black text is easily read on the white background. Black is also used throughout the application for buttons.

- **#FFD700 Gold** is used for the main buttons on every page. Gold is also used for trimming. 

#### Typography

1. [Oswald Font](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Oswald&display=swap) is used for the primary text because it is easy to read. Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.

`font-family: 'Bungee Outline', cursive;`

2. [Bungee Outline](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee+Outline?query=outline) is used for large prominent text to grab the user's attention. Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.

`font-family: 'Bungee Outline', cursive;`

### Development Process

The whole development process is broken down into smaller stages to help in managing the project.

- During the research phase of this project, I posed the following questions to friends, family members and peers living abroad:

- Which Irish goods do you desire most while living abroad?

![CI logo](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/ci_logo_small.png)

Welcome alandoherty95,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
